    The delegate of an `OperationQueue` can respond to `Operation` lifecycle
    events by implementing these methods.

    In general, implementing `OperationQueueDelegate` is not necessary; you would
    want to use an `OperationObserver` instead. However, there are a couple of
    situations where using `OperationQueueDelegate` can lead to simpler code.
    For example, `GroupOperation` is the delegate of its own internal
    `OperationQueue` and uses it to manage dependencies.
