    The delegate of an `OperacjaQueue` can respond to `Operacja` lifecycle
    events by implementing these methods.

    In general, implementing `OperacjaQueueDelegate` is not necessary; you would
    want to use an `OperacjaObserver` instead. However, there are a couple of
    situations where using `OperacjaQueueDelegate` can lead to simpler code.
    For example, `GroupOperacja` is the delegate of its own internal
    `OperacjaQueue` and uses it to manage dependencies.
